# Call for Implementers

Cognisphere is an open architecture for token-efficient, cognitively-inspired memory systems — and it's ready to be built.

## 🛠️ What We Need

We're looking for engineers, tinkerers, and LLM enthusiasts to help bring this architecture to life. Whether you're working in:

- LangChain / LlamaIndex
- GPT APIs or open-source models
- FAISS / Weaviate / Qdrant
- Custom agent frameworks

...there’s a way for you to plug in.

## 🔧 Open Build Ideas

- Surface + heat-layer memory manager
- Chunk storage engine with decay/reinforcement logic
- Core sample retrieval engine with expansion pipeline
- Semantic linking via embedding graphs
- Pilot interface for querying and memory trace visualization

## 👥 Who This Is For

- AI engineers exploring persistent memory
- Agent builders tired of context bloat
- Researchers in artificial cognition
- Teams who want real-time adaptive memory without massive token bills
