# Contributing to Cognisphere

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Cognisphere project! While this repo currently serves as an architectural foundation, we welcome collaboration from engineers, researchers, and system designers who want to help bring it to life.

## üß† What We're Building

Cognisphere is a layered memory system for LLMs inspired by human cognition ‚Äî featuring selective recall, core sampling, semantic pathways, and token-efficient memory management.

## üîç Ways to Contribute

- **Build**: Implement surface/mid/core layers, chunking, embedding logic, or heat tracking
- **Design**: Refine the memory schema, promote scalable memory promotion logic
- **Experiment**: Prototype with vector DBs and LLMs using real-world document sets
- **Improve Docs**: Help clarify concepts or provide examples
- **Offer Feedback**: Suggest refinements, identify gaps, or propose architectural improvements
