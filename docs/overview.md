# Cognisphere Overview

Cognisphere is a modular memory architecture for large language models (LLMs), designed to solve token window limitations and introduce persistent, usage-based recall. Inspired by human cognition, it enables scalable memory without increasing token cost.

## üí° The Problem

Current LLMs face three major memory limitations:

1. **Token Limits**: Even expanded contexts are eventually exceeded.
2. **Inefficient Recall**: Reloading full context on every prompt wastes resources.
3. **No Persistence**: Sessions start fresh, losing prior knowledge.

## üß† The Cognisphere Solution

Cognisphere introduces a spherical, layered memory model:

- **Surface Layer**: Fast-access memory with summaries, embeddings, and metadata.
- **Mid-Layer**: Expandable compressed semantic chunks grouped by topic.
- **Core Layer**: Deep archival storage for infrequently used but valuable memory.

A **Heat Engine** monitors access frequency and recency, promoting "hot" memory and demoting "cold" memory across layers.

## üîç Memory Access Model

Queries trigger semantic search and neural linking across layers. For deep queries, Cognisphere uses **core sampling** ‚Äî a vertical slice of memory expanded on demand, instead of loading entire contexts.

This reduces token use while maintaining intelligent, context-rich interactions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Built With Today's Tools

- Embedding + chunking frameworks
- Vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Weaviate)
- Lightweight DBs for surface metadata
- Modular retrieval logic

## üöÄ Key Benefits

- Bypasses token limits
- Enables persistent, adaptive memory
- Reduces token load by 90‚Äì97%
- Modular, scalable, and compatible with existing LLM ecosystems
